<dd><p><em>Software Engineer at Sogeti</em></p>
<p><strong>Tests platforms</strong> - <em>SWING-WS</em></p>
<p>The aim of the project was to develop the software components of an electronics cards tests bench. The software is composed of two parts, an embedded part (C) used by the microcontroller of the card under test and another part used by the tests sequencer (Java). The tests sequencer commands some elementary functions of the electronic card via a serial link.Purpose. I developed the software part of the tests bench using C and Java programming languages.</p>
<p><em>Technologies:</em> Java, Swing, C</p>
<p><strong>Management of electronics folders</strong> - <em>ORGANIC</em></p>
<p>The application of management of electronics folders is like an application of workflow. For example an employee, who has an issue with his computer, creates a folder which is automatically sent to the support department. A follow up and an historical back-up are automatically made. The interface between the user and the system is a web browser. I analyzed the current system to integrate new functionalities. I participated to the development of a new version in the aim to add new functionalities and improve the ergonomics of the intranet web site.</p>
<p>Technologies: Java, Swing, Oracle, DB2</p>
<p>TableMaster - ATRONIC</p>
<p>The Tablemaster application is used to manage gambling tables in casinos. It is principally used by the croupier via a touch screen. This application has two roles: help the croupier to calculate the stakes and record the all data in the database. The interface between the client on the table and the database is made by a server via a link to the network. I took part to the development of the graphical interface (Java SWING). I also worked on the communication layer between the clients and the server.</p>
<p>Technologies: Java, Swing</p>
